ASCII Art is a fun project that  turns images into ASCII-art. ASCII is a primitive but beautiful art form first developed by the Sumerians in 4000BCE. It is created by printing characters to your terminal so as to recreate the contours of a source image.

The project was inspired by <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/">
